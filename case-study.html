      <h4>Creating an algorithmic art sketch</h4>
        <div class="column">
              <p>I begin the research phase by studying other examples of algorithmic art. To simplify, I decided on rotation and triangles as my theme. Most of the early static designs resemble  flowers.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <p><strong>Randomness - the key element!</strong><br>
              It represents the randomness of life. The sketch include random colors values. The movement occurs in tiny out of control increments. Each rotation is unique. Each new pinwheels leaf appears onto the black screen unexpected and without end.</p>
            <p>By embracing the chaos I accepted that that I had lost control and yet I was not unhappy with the result.</p>
            
              <p><strong>The Coding Process</strong><br>
                  My approach to coding is slow, taking one tiny step at a time.<br>
                  <img src="./images/code2.png">
                  <p>First, I created a rotating triangle. Then I added constraints that move the triangles around the screen. They were a single red color until I finally change the colors. Triangles appearing on the right of the screen gradually turn yellow.

                  <strong> The code complexity builds until I finish strong. </strong>
                  <p>My final step is to organized my thoughts. I finish my documentation. I hope you enjoyed summer pinwheels.
