            <p> I was inspired by a trip to Singapore and the beautiful Gardens by the Bay landscape and architecture. This is an amazing place!</p>

          <p>I focused on 3 aspects: the history, the design and the appeal of the gardens.</p>

          <p>The images are the true heros and the design is based around them. Credits to the amazing photographers: Victor, Justin Lim, Fahrul Amzi, Taylor Simpson and Hu Chen who provided these free images on Unsplash.com. </p>

          <p> For the supertrees I added facts about these sci-fi wonders. The illustrations and icons I created from scratch. The background image is AI generated from the prompt: "leafy jungle trees, palms fronds and palm trees". </p>

        <div class="column">
              <p>In my research phase I studied other examples of algorithmic art. To simplify my project, I decided on rotation and triangles as my theme. Most of the early static designs resemble  flowers.</p>

            <p><strong>Randomness - the key element!</strong><br>
              It represents the randomness of life and is incorporated throughout: with random colors values, the movement occurs in tiny out of control increments; each rotation is unique. Each new pinwheel leaf appears onto the black screen unexpected and without end.</p>
            <p>By embracing the chaos I accepted that that I had lost control and yet I was not unhappy with the result.</p>

              <p><strong>The Coding Process</strong><br>
                  My approach to coding is methodical taking one tiny step at a time.<br></p>

        <div class="column">
                  <p>First, I created a rotating triangle, then added constraints that move the triangles around the screen. They were a single red color until I finally changed the colors. Triangles appearing on the right of the screen gradually turn yellow. </p>
